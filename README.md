this week was our research and documentation project, where Magda and myself chose to use react hook form and react h5 audio player then integrate them together to give us a well rounded audio player with a good user experience.

using the form we had an array of song which were .map onto an option for a select dropdown, after choosing you could click play from the form and it would play on the audio player.

we liked the idea of the form as the custom hook useForm and its methods allowed minimal boilerplate with better performance due to its minimal re rendering by watching the input fields it would only re render what was necessary.

the audio player we liked as it was very customisable and was pretty much ready out of the box, also being able to pass props to it to give it more functionality eg. previous and next song.

the docs for both of these were pretty intuitive and provided demo's so you could visualize what was happening, i especially liked the storybook for the audioplayer as it made it easier to understand what could be done.

credit to lhz516 on github for creating the custimised version of react audio player and making it available without restriction.

i would alos like to mention the songs used in this presentation i do not own the license to share and will be deleted after the presentation, but to any one else using feel free to add your own music to the public/music folder then update paths and titles in the array on the demo page.
